<a name="chapter3"></a>
To Miss <i>Fanny</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
</h2>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Madam,</span><br />
</p>
<p>
It will be naturally expected,
that when I write the
Life of <i>Shamela</i>, I should
dedicate it to some young
Lady, whose Wit and Beauty
might be the proper Subject
of a Comparison with the Heroine
of my Piece. This,
<a name="preface6"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
those, who see I have done it
in prefixing your Name to my
Work, will much more confirmedly
expect me to do;
and, indeed, your Character
would enable me to run some
Length into a Parallel, tho'
you, nor any one else, are at
all like the matchless <i>Shamela</i>.
</p>
<p>
You see, Madam, I have some
Value for your Good-nature,
when in a Dedication, which is
properly a Panegyrick, I speak
against, not for you; but I remember
it is a Life which I
am presenting you, and why
should I expose my Veracity
<a name="preface7"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
to any Hazard in the
Front of the Work, considering
what I have done in the
Body. Indeed, I wish it was
possible to write a Dedication,
and get any thing by it,
without one Word of Flattery;
but since it is not, come
on, and I hope to shew my
Delicacy at least in the Compliments
I intend to pay you.
</p>
<p>
<i>First</i>, then, Madam, I must
tell the World, that you have
tickled up and brightned many
Strokes in this Work by
your Pencil.
<a name="preface8"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Secondly</i>, You have intimately
conversed with me, one
of the greatest Wits and Scholars
of my Age.
</p>
<p>
<i>Thirdly</i>, You keep very
good Hours, and frequently
spend an useful Day before others
begin to enjoy it. This
I will take my Oath on; for
I am admitted to your Presence
in a Morning before other
People's Servants are up;
when I have constantly found
you reading in good Books;
and if ever I have drawn you
upon me, I have always felt
you very heavy.
<a name="preface9"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Fourthly</i>, You have a Virtue
which enables you to rise
early and study hard, and that
is, forbearing to over-eat yourself,
and this in spite of all
the luscious Temptations of
Puddings and Custards, exciting
the Brute (as Dr. <i>Woodward</i>
calls it) to rebel. This
is a Virtue which I can greatly
admire, though I much
question whether I could imitate
it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fifthly</i>, A Circumstance
greatly to your Honour, that
by means of your extraordinary
Merit and Beauty; you was
<a name="preface10"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
carried into the Ball-Room at
the <i>Bath</i>, by the discerning
Mr. <i>Nash</i>; before the Age
that other young Ladies generally
arrived at that Honour,
and while your Mamma
herself existed in her perfect
Bloom. Here you was observed
in Dancing to balance
your Body exactly, and to
weigh every Motion with the
exact and equal Measure of
Time and Tune; and though
you sometimes made a false
Step, by leaning too much to
one Side; yet every body said
you would one time or other,
dance perfectly well, and uprightly.
<a name="preface11"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sixthly</i>, I cannot forbear
mentioning those pretty little
Sonnets, and sprightly Compositions,
which though they
came from you with so much
Ease, might be mentioned to
the Praise of a great or grave
Character.
</p>
<p>
And now, Madam, I have
done with you; it only remains
to pay my Acknowledgments
to an Author, whose
Stile I have exactly followed
in this Life, it being the properest
for Biography. The
Reader, I believe, easily
guesses, I mean <i>Euclid's Elements</i>;
<a name="preface12"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
it was <i>Euclid</i> who
taught me to write. It is
you, Madam, who pay me
for Writing. Therefore I am
to both,

<p>
However you came by the excellent

Favour, Dedication and all; believe me, it
will go through many Editions, be translated
into all Languages, read in all Nations and

<i>SIR</i>,<br />
</p>
<p>
I have read your <i>Shamela</i> through and
through, and a most inimitable Performance
it is. Who is he, what is he that could write
so excellent a Book? he must be doubtless most
agreeable to the Age, and to <i>his Honour</i> himself;
for he is able to draw every thing to
Perfection but Virtue. Whoever the Author
be, he hath one of the worst and most fashionable
Hearts in the World, and I would recommend
to him, in his next Performance, to undertake
the Life of <i>his Honour</i>. For he who
drew the Character of Parson <i>Williams</i>, is equal
to the Task; nay he seems to have little more
to do than to pull off the Parson's Gown, and
<i>that</i> which makes him so agreeable to <i>Shamela</i>,
and the Cap will fit.

AN<br />
APOLOGY<br />
For the LIFE of<br />
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Shamela Andrews</span>.<br />
</h2>
<h3>
<i>Parson</i> <span class="smcap">Tickletext</span> <i>to Parson</i> <span class="smcap">Oliver</span>.
</h3>
<p class="nowrap">
<i>Rev. SIR</i>,<br />
</p>
<p>
Herewith I transmit you a Copy
of sweet, dear, pretty <i>Pamela</i>, a little
Book which this Winter hath produced,
of which, I make no doubt, you have
already heard mention from some of your Neighbouring
Clergy; for we have made it our common
Business here, not only to cry it up, but to preach
it up likewise: The Pulpit, as well as the Coffee-house,
hath resounded with its Praise, and it is
expected shortly, that his L&mdash;p will recommend
it in a &mdash;&mdash; Letter to our whole Body.
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;2]</span>
</p>
<p>
And this Example, I am confident, will be
imitated by all our Cloth in the Country: For
besides speaking well of a Brother, in the Character
of the Reverend Mr. <i>Williams</i>, the useful
and truly religious Doctrine of <i>Grace</i> is every
where inculcated.
</p>
<p>
This Book is the &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Soul</span> of <i>Religion</i>, Good-Breeding,
Discretion, Good-Nature, Wit,
Fancy, Fine Thought, and Morality. There
is an Ease, a natural Air, a dignified Simplicity,
and <span class="smcap">Measured Fullness</span> in it, that
<span class="smcap">resembling Life, out-glows it</span>. The
Author hath reconciled the <i>pleasing</i> to the <i>proper</i>;
the Thought is every where exactly
cloathed by the Expression; and becomes its
Dress as <i>roundly</i> and as close as <i>Pamela</i> her
Country Habit; or <i>as she doth her no Habit</i>,
when modest Beauty seeks to hide itself, by
casting off the Pride of Ornament, and displays
itself without any Covering;&rdquo; which it
frequently doth in this admirable Work, and presents
Images to the Reader, which the coldest
Zealot cannot read without Emotion.
</p>
<p>
For my own Part (and, I believe, I may say
the same of all the Clergy of my Acquaintance)
&ldquo;I have done nothing but read it to others, and
hear others again read it to me, ever since it
came into my Hands; and I find I am like to
do nothing else, for I know not how long yet
to come: because if I lay the Book down <i>it
comes after me</i>. When it has dwelt all Day
long upon the Ear, it takes Possession all
Night of the Fancy. It hath Witchcraft in
every Page of it.&mdash;&mdash;Oh! I feel an Emotion
even while I am relating this: Methinks I
see <i>Pamela</i> at this Instant, with all the Pride of
Ornament cast off.
<a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;3]</span>
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Little Book, charming <i>Pamela</i>, get thee
gone; face the World, in which thou wilt
find nothing like thyself.&rdquo; Happy would it
be for Mankind, if all other Books were burnt,
that we might do nothing but read thee all Day,
and dream of thee all Night. Thou alone art
sufficient to teach us as much Morality as we
want. Dost thou not teach us to pray, to sing
Psalms, and to honour the Clergy? Are not
these the whole Duty of Man? Forgive me, O
Author of <i>Pamela</i>, mentioning the Name of a
Book so unequal to thine: But, now I think of
it, who is the Author, where is he, what is he,
that hath hitherto been able to hide such an encircling,
all-mastering Spirit, &ldquo;he possesses every
Quality that Art could have charm'd by: yet
hath lent it to and concealed it in Nature.
The Comprehensiveness of his Imagination
must be truly prodigious! It has stretched out
this diminutive mere Grain of Mustard-seed
(a poor Girl's little, <i>&amp;c.</i>) into a Resemblance
of that Heaven, which the best of good Books
has compared it to.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
To be short, this Book will live to the Age of
the Patriarchs, and like them will carry on the
good Work many hundreds of Years hence,
among our Posterity, who will not <span class="allsmcap">HESITATE</span>
their Esteem with Restraint. If the <i>Romans</i>
granted Exemptions to Men who begat a <i>few</i>
Children for the Republick, what Distinction (if
Policy and we should ever be reconciled) should
we find to reward this Father of Millions, which
are to owe Formation to the future Effect of his
Influence.&mdash;&mdash;I feel another Emotion.
</p>
<p>
As soon as you have read this yourself five or
six Times over (which may possibly happen
within a Week) I desire you would give it to
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
my little God-Daughter, as a Present from me.
This being the only Education we intend henceforth
to give our Daughters. And pray let your
Servant-Maids read it over, or read it to them.
Both your self and the neighbouring Clergy, will
supply yourselves for the Pulpit from the Book-sellers,
as soon as the fourth Edition is published.
I am,

<p class="nowrap">
<i>Rev. SIR</i>,<br />
</p>
<p>
I Received the Favour of yours with the inclosed
Book, and really must own myself sorry,
to see the Report I have heard of an epidemical
Phrenzy now raging in Town, confirmed
in the Person of my Friend.
</p>
<p>
If I had not known your Hand, I should,
from the Sentiments and Stile of the Letter, have
imagined it to have come from the Author of
the famous Apology, which was sent me last
Summer; and on my reading the remarkable Paragraph
of <i>measured Fulness, that resembling Life
out-glows it</i>, to a young Baronet, he cry'd out,
<i>C&mdash;&mdash;ly C&mdash;&mdash;b&mdash;r</i> by G&mdash;&mdash;. But I have since
observed, that this, as well as many other Expressions
in your Letter, was borrowed from those
remarkable Epistles, which the Author, or the
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
Editor hath prefix'd to the second Edition which
you send me of his Book.
</p>
<p>
Is it possible that you or any of your Function
can be in earnest, or think the Cause of Religion,
or Morality, can want such slender Support? God
forbid they should. As for Honour to the
Clergy, I am sorry to see them so solicitous about
it; for if worldly Honour be meant, it is what
their Predecessors in the pure and primitive Age,
never had or sought. Indeed the secure Satisfaction
of a good Conscience, the Approbation of
the Wise and Good, (which, never were or will
be the Generality of Mankind) and the extatick
Pleasure of contemplating, that their Ways are
acceptable to the Great Creator of the Universe,
will always attend those, who really deserve
these Blessings: But for worldly Honours, they
are often the Purchase of Force and Fraud, we
sometimes see them in an eminent Degree possessed
by Men, who are notorious for Luxury, Pride,
Cruelty, Treachery, and the most abandoned
Prostitution; Wretches who are ready to invent
and maintain Schemes repugnant to the Interest,
the Liberty, and the Happiness of Mankind,
not to supply their Necessities, or even Conveniencies,
but to pamper their Avarice and Ambition.
And if this be the Road to worldly Honours,
God forbid the Clergy should be even
suspected of walking in it.
</p>
<p>
The History of <i>Pamela</i> I was acquainted with
long before I received it from you, from my
Neighbourhood to the Scene of Action. Indeed
I was in hopes that young Woman would
have contented herself with the Good-fortune she
hath attained; and rather suffered her little Arts
to have been forgotten than have revived their
Remembrance, and endeavoured by perverting
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
and misrepresenting Facts to be thought to deserve
what she now enjoys: for though we do
not imagine her the Author of the Narrative itself,
yet we must suppose the Instructions were
given by her, as well as the Reward, to the Composer.
Who that is, though you so earnestly require
of me, I shall leave you to guess from that
<i>Ciceronian</i> Eloquence, with which the Work
abounds; and that excellent Knack of making
every Character amiable, which he lays his hands
on.
</p>
<p>
But before I send you some Papers relating to
this Matter, which will set <i>Pamela</i> and some
others in a very different Light, than that in
which they appear in the printed Book, I must
beg leave to make some few Remarks on the
Book itself, and its Tendency, (admitting it to
be a true Relation,) towards improving Morality,
or doing any good, either to the present Age, or
Posterity: which when I have done, I shall, I
flatter myself, stand excused from delivering it,
either into the hands of my Daughter, or my
Servant-Maid.
</p>
<p>
The Instruction which it conveys to Servant-Maids,
is, I think, very plainly this, To look
out for their Masters as sharp as they can. The
Consequences of which will be, besides Neglect
of their Business, and the using all manner of
Means to come at Ornaments of their Persons,
that if the Master is not a Fool, they will be debauched
by him; and if he is a Fool, they will
marry him. Neither of which, I apprehend,
my good Friend, we desire should be the Case
of our Sons.
</p>
<p>
And notwithstanding our Author's Professions
of Modesty, which in my Youth I have heard at
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
the Beginning of an Epilogue, I cannot agree
that my Daughter should entertain herself with
some of his Pictures; which I do not expect to
be contemplated without Emotion, unless by one
of my Age and Temper, who can see the Girl
lie on her Back, with one Arm round Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i>
and the other round the Squire, naked in Bed,
with his Hand on her Breasts, <i>&amp;c.</i> with as much
Indifference as I read any other Page in the whole
Novel. But surely this, and some other Descriptions,
will not be put into the hands of his
Daughter by any wise Man, though I believe it
will be difficult for him to keep them from her;
especially if the Clergy in Town have cried and
preached it up as you say.
</p>
<p>
But, my Friend, the whole Narrative is such
a Misrepresentation of Facts, such a Perversion
of Truth, as you will, I am perswaded, agree,
as soon as you have perused the Papers I now inclose
to you, that I hope you or some other well-disposed
Person, will communicate these Papers
to the Publick, that this little Jade may not impose
on the World, as she hath on her Master.
</p>
<p>
The true name of this Wench was <span class="smcap">Shamela</span>,
and not <i>Pamela</i>, as she stiles herself. Her Father
had in his Youth the Misfortune to appear
in no good Light at the <i>Old-Bailey</i>; he afterwards
served in the Capacity of a Drummer in
one of the <i>Scotch</i> Regiments in the <i>Dutch</i> Service;
where being drummed out, he came over
to <i>England</i>, and turned Informer against several
Persons on the late Gin-Act; and becoming acquainted
with an Hostler at an Inn, where a <i>Scotch</i>
Gentleman's Horses stood, he hath at last by his Interest
obtain'd a pretty snug Place in the <i>Custom-house</i>.
Her Mother sold Oranges in the Play-House;
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
and whether she was married to her Father or
no, I never could learn.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
After this short Introduction, the rest of her
History will appear in the following Letters,
which I assure you are authentick.

<i>Dear Sham</i>,<br />

<p>
Your last Letter hath put me into a great
hurry of Spirits, for you have a very difficult
Part to act. I hope you will remember your
Slip with Parson <i>Williams</i>, and not be guilty of
any more such Folly. Truly, a Girl who hath once
known what is what, is in the highest Degree inexcusable
if she respects her <i>Digressions</i>; but a
Hint of this is sufficient. When Mrs. <i>Jervis</i>
thinks of coming to Town, I believe I can procure
her a good House, and fit for the Business;

Why will you give such way to your Passion?
How could you imagine I should
be such a Simpleton, as to upbraid thee with being

you not to be guilty of Folly, I meant no

paid before-hand, and not trust to Promises, which
a Man seldom keeps, after he hath had his wicked
Will. And seeing you have a rich Fool to deal
with, your not making a good Market will be
the more inexcusable; indeed, with such Gentlemen

said; for they have nothing to give, and are commonly
otherwise the best sort of Men. I am

<p>
O Madam, I have strange Things to tell you!
As I was reading in that charming Book
about the Dealings, in comes my Master&mdash;to be
sure he is a precious One. <i>Pamela</i>, says he,
what Book is that, I warrant you <i>Rochester's</i>
Poems.&mdash;No, forsooth, says I, as pertly as I
could; why how now Saucy Chops, Boldface, says
he&mdash;Mighty pretty Words, says I, pert again.&mdash;Yes
(says he) you are a d&mdash;d, impudent,
stinking, cursed, confounded Jade, and I have a
great Mind to kick your A&mdash;&mdash;. You, kiss &mdash;&mdash; says
I. A-gad, says he, and so I will; with that
he caught me in his Arms, and kissed me till he
made my Face all over Fire. Now this served
purely you know, to put upon the Fool for Anger.
O! What precious Fools Men are! And
so I flung from him in a mighty Rage, and pretended
as how I would go out at the Door; but
when I came to the End of the Room, I stood still,
and my Master cryed out, Hussy, Slut, Saucebox,
Boldface, come hither&mdash;&mdash;Yes to be
sure, says I; why don't you come, says he; what
should I come for says I; if you don't come to
me, I'll come to you, says he; I shan't come to
you I assure you, says I. Upon which he run
up, caught me in his Arms, and flung me upon a
Chair, and began to offer to touch my Under-Petticoat.
Sir, says I, you had better not offer
to be rude; well, says he, no more I won't then;
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;14]</span>
and away he went out of the Room. I was so
mad to be sure I could have cry'd.
</p>
<p>
<i>Oh what a prodigious Vexation it is to a Woman
to be made a Fool of.</i>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. <i>Jervis</i> who had been without, harkening,
now came to me. She burst into a violent Laugh
the Moment she came in. Well, says she, as
soon as she could speak, I have Reason to bless
myself that I am an Old Woman. Ah Child!
if you had known the Jolly Blades of my Age,
you would not have been left in the lurch in
this manner. Dear Mrs. <i>Jervis</i>, says I, don't
laugh at one; and to be sure I was a little angry
With her.&mdash;&mdash;Come, says she, my dear Honeysuckle,
I have one Game to play for you; he
shall see you in Bed; he shall, my little Rosebud,
he shall see those pretty, little, white, round,
panting&mdash;&mdash;and offer'd to pull off my Handkerchief.&mdash;Fie,
Mrs. <i>Jervis</i>, says I, you make
me blush, and upon my Fackins, I believe she
did: She went on thus. I know the Squire likes
you, and notwithstanding the Aukwardness of
his Proceeding, I am convinced hath some hot
Blood in his Veins, which will not let him rest,
'till he hath communicated some of his Warmth
to thee my little Angel; I heard him last Night
at our Door, trying if it was open, now to-night
I will take care it shall be so; I warrant that
he makes the second Trial; which if he doth, he
shall find us ready to receive him. I will at first
counterfeit Sleep, and after a Swoon; so that
he will have you naked in his Possession: and
then if you are disappointed, a Plague of all
young Squires, say I.&mdash;&mdash;And so, Mrs. <i>Jervis</i>,
says I, you would have me yield myself to him,
would you; you would have me be a second
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;15]</span>
Time a Fool for nothing. Thank you for that,
Mrs. <i>Jervis</i>. For nothing! marry forbid, says she,
you know he hath large Sums of Money, besides
abundance of fine Things; and do you think,
when you have inflamed him, by giving his
Hand a Liberty with that charming Person;
and that you know he may easily think he obtains
against your Will, he will not give any thing
to come at all&mdash;&mdash;. This will not do,
Mrs. <i>Jervis</i>, answered I. I Have heard my
Mamma say, (and so you know, Madam, I
have) that in her Youth, Fellows have often taken
away in the Morning, what they gave over
Night. No, Mrs. <i>Jervis</i>, nothing under a regular
taking into Keeping, a settled Settlement,
for me, and all my Heirs, all my whole Life-time,
shall do the Business&mdash;&mdash;or else cross-legged,
is the Word, faith, with <i>Sham</i>; and then
I snapt my Fingers.
</p>
<h3>
<a name="section11_2"></a>
<i>Thursday Night, Twelve o'Clock.</i>
</h3>
<p>
Mrs. <i>Jervis</i> and I are just in Bed, and the
Door unlocked; if my Master should come&mdash;&mdash;Odsbobs!
I hear him just coming in at the Door.
You see I write in the present Tense, as Parson
<i>Williams</i> says. Well, he is in Bed between us,
we both shamming a Sleep, he steals his Hand
into my Bosom, which I, as if in my Sleep,
press close to me with mine, and then pretend to
awake.&mdash;I no sooner see him, but I Scream out
to Mrs. <i>Jervis</i>, she feigns likewise but just to
come to herself; we both begin, she to becall,
and I to bescratch very liberally. After having
made a pretty free Use of my Fingers, without
any great Regard to the Parts I attack'd, I counterfeit
a Swoon. Mrs. <i>Jervis</i> then cries out, O,
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;16]</span>
Sir, what have you done, you have murthered
poor <i>Pamela</i>: she is gone, she is gone.&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>O what a Difficulty it is to keep one's Countenance,
when a violent Laugh desires to burst
forth.</i>
</p>
<p>
The poor Booby frightned out of his Wits,
jumped out of Bed, and, in his Shirt, sat down
by my Bed-Side, pale and trembling, for the
Moon shone, and I kept my Eyes wide open,
and pretended to fix them in my Head. Mrs.
<i>Jervis</i> apply'd Lavender Water, and Hartshorn,
and this, for a full half Hour; when thinking
I had carried it on long enough, and being likewise
unable to continue the Sport any longer, I
began by Degrees to come to my self.
</p>
<p>
The Squire, who had sat all this while speechless,
and was almost really in that Condition,
which I feigned, the Moment he Saw me give
Symptoms of recovering my Senses, fell down on
his Knees; and O <i>Pamela</i>, cryed he, can you
forgive me, my injured Maid? by Heaven, I
know not whether you are a Man or a Woman,
unless by your swelling Breasts. Will you promise
to forgive me: I forgive you! D&mdash;n you
(says I) and d&mdash;n you says he, if you come to
that. I wish I had never seen your bold Face,
saucy Sow, and so went out of the Room.
</p>
<p>
<i>O what a silly Fellow is a bashful young Lover!</i>
</p>
<p>
He was no Sooner out of hearing, as we
thought, than we both burst into a violent
Laugh. Well, says Mrs. <i>Jervis</i>, I never saw
any thing better acted than your Part: But I
wish you may not have discouraged him from
any future Attempt; especially since his Passions
are so cool, that you could prevent his Hands
going further than your Bosom. Hang him, answered
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;17]</span>
I, he is not quite so cold as that I assure
you; our Hands, on neither side, were idle in
the Scuffle, nor have left us any Doubt of each
other as to that matter.
</p>
<h3>
<a name="section11_3"></a>
<i>Friday Morning.</i>
</h3>
<p>
My Master sent for Mrs. <i>Jervis</i> as soon as he
was up, and bid her give an Account of the
Plate and Linnen in her Care; and told her, he
was resolved that both she and the little Gipsy
(I'll assure him) should set out together. Mrs.
<i>Jervis</i> made him a saucy Answer; which any
Servant of Spirit, you know, would, tho' it should
be one's Ruin; and came immediately in Tears
to me, crying, she had lost her Place on my
Account, and that she should be forced to take
to a House, as I mentioned before; and that
she hoped I would, at least, make her all the
amends in my power, for her Loss on my Account,
and come to her House whenever I was
sent for. Never fear, says I, I'll warrant we are
not so near being turned away, as you imagine;
and, i'cod, now it comes into my Head, I have
a Fetch for him, and you shall assist me in it.
But it being now late, and my Letter pretty long,
no more at present from

</h3>
<p class="nowrap">
<i>Madam</i>,<br />
</p>
<p>
Miss <i>Sham</i> being set out in a Hurry for
my Master's House in <i>Lincolnshire</i>, desired
me to acquaint you with the Success of her
Stratagem, which was to dress herself in the plain
Neatness of a Farmer's Daughter, for she before
wore the Cloaths of my late Mistress, and to be
introduced by me as a Stranger to her Master.
To say the Truth, she became the Dress extremely,
and if I was to keep a House a thousand Years,
I would never desire a prettier Wench in it.
</p>
<p>
As soon as my Master saw her, he immediately
threw his Arms round her Neck, and smothered
her with Kisses (for indeed he hath but very
little to say for himself to a Woman.) He swore
that <i>Pamela</i> was an ugly Slut, (pardon, dear Madam,
the Coarseness of the Expression) compared
to such divine Excellence. He added, he would
turn <i>Pamela</i> away immediately, and take this new
Girl, whom he thought to be one of his Tenant's
Daughters, in her Room.
</p>
<p>
Miss <i>Sham</i> smiled at these Words, and so did
your humble Servant, which he perceiving, looked
very earnestly at your fair Daughter, and
discovered the Cheat.
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;19]</span>
</p>
<p>
How, <i>Pamela</i>, says he, is it you? I thought,
Sir, said Miss, after what had happened, you
would have known me in any Dress. No, Hussy,
says he, but after what hath happened, I should
know thee out of any Dress from all thy Sex.
He then was what we Women call rude, when
done in the Presence of others; but it seems it is
not the first time, and Miss defended herself with
great Strength and Spirit.
</p>
<p>
The Squire, who thinks her a pure Virgin,
and who knows nothing of my Character, resolved
to send her into <i>Lincolnshire</i>, on Pretence of conveying
her home; where our old Friend <i>Nanny
Jewkes</i> is Housekeeper, and where Miss had her
small one by Parson <i>Williams</i> about a Year ago.
This is a Piece of News communicated to us by
<i>Robin</i> Coachman, who is intrusted by his Master
to carry on this Affair privately for him: But we
hang together, I believe, as well as any Family
of Servants in the Nation.
</p>
<p>
You will, I believe, Madam, wonder that
the Squire, who doth not want Generosity, should
never have mentioned a Settlement all this while,
I believe it slips his Memory: But it will not be
long first, no doubt: For, as I am convinced
the young Lady will do nothing unbecoming
your Daughter, nor ever admit him to taste her
Charms, without something sure and handsome
before-hand; so, I am certain, the Squire will
never rest till they have danced <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve's</i>
kissing Dance together. Your Daughter set out
Yesterday Morning, and told me, as soon as she
arrived, you might depend on hearing from
her.
</p>
<p>
Be pleased to make my Compliments acceptable
to Mrs. <i>Davis</i> and Mrs. <i>Silvester</i>, and Mrs.
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;20]</span>

given me, you will see me soon, and I will lodge
in the same House with you, if you have
room, till I can provide for my self to my Liking.

<i>Dear Mamma</i>,<br />

I Suppose Mrs. <i>Jervis</i> acquainted you with
what past 'till I left <i>Bedfordshire</i>; whence I
am after a very pleasant Journey arrived in <i>Lincolnshire</i>,
with your old Acquaintance Mrs.
<i>Jewkes</i>, who formerly helped Parson <i>Williams</i> to
me; and now designs I see, to sell me to my
Master; thank her for that; she will find two
Words go to that Bargain.
</p>
<p>
The Day after my Arrival here, I received
a Letter from Mr. <i>Williams</i>, and as you have

it to you; it is, I think, the finest I ever received

<p>
Having learnt by means of my Clerk,
who Yesternight visited the Rev<sup>d</sup>. Mr. <i>Peters</i>
with my Commands, that you are returned
into this County, I purposed to have saluted
your fair Hands this Day towards Even: But
am obliged to sojourn this Night at a neighbouring
Clergyman's; where we are to pierce a Virgin
Barrel of Ale, in a Cup of which I shall
not be unmindful to celebrate your Health.
</p>
<p>
I hope you have remembered your Promise,
to bring me a leaden Canister of Tobacco (the
Saffron Cut) for in Troth, this Country at present
affords nothing worthy the replenishing a
Tube with.&mdash;&mdash;Some I tasted, the other Day
at an Alehouse, gave me the Heart-Burn, tho' I
filled no oftner than five times.
</p>
<p>
I was greatly concerned to learn, that your late
Lady left you nothing, tho' I cannot say the
Tidings much surprized me: For I am too intimately
acquainted with the Family; (myself,
Father, and Grandfather having been successive Incumbents
on the same Cure, which you know is
in their Gift) I say, I am too well acquainted
with them to expect much from their Generosity.
They are in Verity, as worthless a Family as any
other whatever. The young Gentleman I am informed,
is a perfect Reprobate that he hath an
<i>Ingenium Versatile</i> to every Species of Vice,
which, indeed, no one can much wonder at, who
animadverts on that want of Respect to the Clergy,
which was observable in him when a Child,
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;23]</span>
I remember when he was at the Age of Eleven
only, he met my Father without either pulling
off his Hat, or riding out of the way. Indeed,
a Contempt of the Clergy is the fashionable Vice
of the Times; but let such Wretches know, they
cannot hate, detest, and despise us, half so much
as we do them.
</p>
<p>
However, I have prevailed on myself to write
a civil Letter to your Master, as there is a Probability
of his being shortly in a Capacity of
rendring me a Piece of Service; my good Friend
and Neighbour the Rev<sup>d</sup>. Mr. <i>Squeeze-Tithe</i> being,
as I am informed by one whom I have
employed to attend for that Purpose, very near
his Dissolution.
</p>
<p>
You see, sweet Mrs. <i>Pamela</i>, the Confidence
with which I dictate these Things to you; whom
after those Endearments which have passed between
us, I must in some Respects estimate as
my Wife: For tho' the Omission of the Service
was a Sin; yet, as I have told you, it was a venial
One, of which I have truly repented, as I
hope you have; and also that you have continued
the wholsome Office of reading good Books, and
are improved in your Psalmody, of which I
shall have a speedy Trial: For I purpose to give
you a Sermon next <i>Sunday</i>, and shall spend the
Evening with you, in Pleasures, which tho' not
strictly innocent, are however to be purged
away by frequent and sincere Repentance.

You find, Mamma, what a charming way he
hath of Writing, and yet I assure you, that is not
the most charming thing belonging to him: For,
tho' he doth not put any Dears, and Sweets, and
Loves into his Letters, yet he says a thousand of
them: For he can be as fond of a Woman, as
any Man living.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sure Women are great Fools, when they prefer
a laced Coat to the Clergy, whom it is our Duty
to honour and respect.</i>
</p>
<p>
Well, on <i>Sunday</i> Parson <i>Williams</i> came, according
to his Promise, and an excellent Sermon
he preached; his Text was, <i>Be not Righteous
over much</i>; and, indeed, he handled it in a very
fine way; he shewed us that the Bible doth not
require too much Goodness of us, and that People
very often call things Goodness that are not so.
That to go to Church, and to pray, and to sing
Psalms, and to honour the Clergy, and to repent,
is true Religion; and 'tis not doing good to
one another, for that is one of the greatest Sins
we can commit, when we don't do it for the sake
of Religion. That those People who talk of
Vartue and Morality, are the wickedest of all
Persons. That 'tis not what we do, but what
we believe, that must save us, and a great many
other good Things; I wish I could remember
them all.
</p>
<p>
As soon as Church was over, he came to the
Squire's House, and drank Tea with Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i>
and me; after which Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> went out and
left us together for an Hour and half&mdash;Oh! he
is a charming Man.
</p>
<p>
After Supper he went Home, and then Mrs.
<i>Jewkes</i> began to catechize me, about my Familiarity
with him. I see she wants him herself.
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;25]</span>
Then she proceeded to tell me what an Honour
my Master did me in liking me, and that it was
both an inexcusable Folly and Pride in me, to
pretend to refuse him any Favour. Pray, Madam,
says I, consider I am a poor Girl, and
have nothing but my Modesty to trust to. If I
part with that, what will become of me. Methinks,
says she, you are not so mighty modest
when you are with Parson <i>Williams</i>; I have observed
you gloat at one another, in a Manner that
hath made me blush. I assure you, I shall let
the Squire know what sort of Man he is; you
may do your Will, says I, as long as he hath a
Vote for Pallamant-Men, the Squire dares do nothing
to offend him; and you will only shew
that you are jealous of him, and that's all. How
now, Mynx, says she; Mynx! No more Mynx
than yourself, says I; with that she hit me a Slap
on the Shoulder; and I flew at her and scratched
her Face, i'cod, 'till she went crying out of
the Room; so no more at present, from

<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;27]</span>
best Man in the World, notwithstanding your
Treatment of him. My Treatment of him,
Madam, says I? Yes, says she, your Insensibility
to the Honour he intends you, of making
you his Mistress. I would have you to know,
Madam, I would not be Mistress to the greatest
King, no nor Lord in the Universe. I value
my Vartue more than I do any thing my Master
can give me; and so we talked a full Hour and
a half, about my Vartue; and I was afraid at
first, she had heard something about the Bantling,
but I find she hath not; tho' she is as jealous,
and suspicious, as old Scratch.
</p>
<p>
In the Afternoon, I stole into the Garden to
meet Mr. <i>Williams</i>; I found him at the Place of
his Appointment, and we staid in a kind of
Arbour, till it was quite dark. He was very
angry when I told him what Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> had
threatned&mdash;&mdash;Let him refuse me the Living,
says he, if he dares, I will vote for the other
Party; and not only so, but will expose him all
over the Country. I owe him 150<i>l.</i> indeed,
but I don't care for that; by that time the
Election is past, I shall be able to plead
the <i>Statue</i> of <i>Lamentations</i>.
</p>
<p>
I could have stayed with the dear Man forever,
but when it grew dark, he told me, he was to
meet the neighbouring Clergy, to finish the Barrel
of Ale they had tapped the other Day, and
believed they should not part till three or four in
the Morning&mdash;&mdash;So he left me, and I promised
to be penitent, and go on with my reading in
good Books.
</p>
<p>
As soon as he was gone, I bethought myself,
what Excuse I should make to Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i>, and
it came into my Head to pretend as how I intended
<a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;28]</span>
to drown myself; so I stript off one of my Petticoats,
and threw it into the Canal; and then I
went and hid myself in the Coal-hole, where I
lay all Night; and comforted myself with repeating
over some Psalms, and other good things,
which I had got by heart.
</p>
<p>
In the Morning Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> and all the Servants
were frighted out of their Wits, thinking
I had run away; and not devising how they
should answer it to their Master. They searched
all the likeliest Places they could think of for me,
and at last saw my Petticoat floating in the Pond.
Then they got a Drag-Net, imagining I was
drowned, and intending to drag me out; but at
last <i>Moll</i> Cook coming for some Coals, discovered
me lying all along in no very good Pickle.
Bless me! Mrs. <i>Pamela</i>, says she, what can be
the Meaning of this? I don't know, says I,
help me up, and I will go in to Breakfast, for
indeed I am very hungry. Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> came in
immediately, and was so rejoyced to find me alive,
that she asked with great Good-Humour, where I
had been? and how my Petticoat came into the
Pond. I answered, I believed the Devil had put
it into my Head to drown my self; but it was a
Fib; for I never saw the Devil in my Life, nor
I don't believe he hath any thing to do with
me.
</p>
<p>
So much for this Matter. As soon as I had
breakfasted, a Coach and Six came to the Door,
and who should be in it but my Master.
</p>
<p>
I immediately run up into my Room, and stript,
and washed, and drest my self as well as I could,
and put on my prettiest round-ear'd Cap, and
pulled down my Stays, to shew as much as I
could of my Bosom, (for Parson <i>Williams</i> says
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;29]</span>
that is the most beautiful part of a Woman) and
then I practised over all my Airs before the Glass,
and then I sat down and read a Chapter in the
Whole Duty of Man.
</p>
<p>
Then Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> came to me and told me,
my Master wanted me below, and says she,
Don't behave like a Fool; No, thinks I to my
self, I believe I shall find Wit enough for my
Master and you too.
</p>
<p>
So down goes me I into the Parlour to him.
<i>Pamela</i>, says he, the Moment I came in, you see
I cannot stay long from you, which I think is
a sufficient Proof of the Violence of my Passion.
Yes, Sir, says I, I see your Honour intends to
ruin me, that nothing but the Destruction of my
Vartue will content you.
</p>
<p>
<i>O what a charming Word that is, rest his Soul
who first invented it.</i>
</p>
<p>
How can you say I would ruin you, answered
the Squire, when you shall not ask any thing
which I will not grant you. If that be true, says
I, good your Honour let me go home to my
poor but honest Parents; that is all I have to ask,
and do not ruin a poor Maiden, who is resolved
to carry her Vartue to the Grave with her.
</p>
<p>
Hussy, says he, don't provoke me, don't provoke
me, I say. You are absolutely in my
power, and if you won't let me lie with you by
fair Means, I will by Force. O la, Sir, says I,
I don't understand your paw Words.&mdash;&mdash;Very
pretty Treatment indeed, says he, to say I use
paw Words; Hussy, Gipsie, Hypocrite, Saucebox,
Boldface, get out of my Sight, or I will
lend you such a Kick in the &mdash;&mdash; I don't care to
repeat the Word, but he meant my hinder part.
I was offering to go away, for I was half afraid,
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;30]</span>
when he called me back, and took me round the
Neck and kissed me, and then bid me go about
my Business.
</p>
<p>
I went directly into my Room, where Mrs.
<i>Jewkes</i> came to me soon afterwards. So Madam,
says she, you have left my Master below in a fine
Pet, he hath threshed two or three of his Men
already: It is might pretty that all his Servants
are to be punished for your Impertinence.
</p>
<p>
Harkee, Madam, says I, don't you affront
me, for if you do, d&mdash;n me (I am sure I have
repented for using such a Word) if I am not revenged.
</p>
<p>
<i>How sweet is Revenge: Sure the Sermon Book
is in the Right, in calling it the sweetest Morsel
the Devil ever dropped into the Mouth of a Sinner.</i>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> remembered the Smart of my Nails
too well to go farther, and so we sat down and
talked about my Vartue till Dinner-time, and
then I was sent for to wait on my Master. I took
care to be often caught looking at him, and then
I always turn'd away my Eyes, and pretended to
be ashamed. As soon as the Cloth was removed,
he put a Bumper of Champagne into my Hand,
and bid me drink&mdash;&mdash;O la I can't name the
Health. Parson <i>Williams</i> may well say he is a
wicked Man.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> took a Glass and drank the dear
<i>Monysyllable</i>; I don't understand that Word, but
I believe it is baudy. I then drank towards his
Honour's good Pleasure. Ay, Hussy, says he,
you can give me Pleasure if you will; Sir, says
I, I shall be always glad to do what is in my
power, and so I pretended not to know what he
meant. Then he took me into his Lap.&mdash;O
Mamma, I could tell you something if I would&mdash;and
<a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;31]</span>
he kissed me&mdash;&mdash;and I said I won't be slobber'd
about so, so I won't; and he bid me get
out of the Room for a saucy Baggage, and said
he had a good mind to spit in my Face.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sure no Man over took such a Method to gain
a Woman's Heart.</i>
</p>
<p>
I had not been long in my Chamber before
Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> came to me, and told me, my Master
would not see me any more that Evening, that
is, if he can help it; for, added she, I easily
perceive the great Ascendant you have over him,
and to confess the Truth, I don't doubt but you
will shortly be my Mistress.
</p>
<p>
What says I, dear Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i>, what do you
say? Don't flatter a poor Girl, it is impossible
his Honour can have any honourable Design upon
me. And so we talked of honourable Designs
till Supper-time. And Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> and I supped
together upon a hot buttered Apple-Pie; and
about ten o'Clock we went to Bed.
</p>
<p>
We had not been a Bed half an Hour, when
my Master came pit a pat into the Room in his
Shirt as before. I pretended not to hear him, and
Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> laid hold of one Arm, and he pulled
down the Bed cloaths and came into Bed on the
other Side, and took my other Arm and laid it under
him, and fell a kissing one of my Breasts as if he
would have devoured it; I was then forced to
awake, and began to struggle with him, Mrs.
<i>Jewkes</i> crying why don't you do it? I have one
Arm secure, if you can't deal with the rest I am
sorry for you. He was as rude as possible to me;
but I remembered, Mamma, the Instructions you
gave me to avoid being ravished, and followed
them, which soon brought him to Terms, and
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;32]</span>
he promised me, on quitting my hold, that he
would leave the Bed.
</p>
<p>
<i>O Parson</i> Williams, <i>how little are all the Men
in the World compared to thee</i>.
</p>
<p>
My Master was as good as his Word; upon
which Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> said, O Sir, I see you know
very little of our <i>Sect</i>, by parting so easily from
the Blessing when you was so near it. No, Mrs.
<i>Jewkes</i>, answered he, I am very glad no more
hath happened, I would not have injured <i>Pamela</i>
for the World. And to-morrow Morning perhaps
she may hear of something to her Advantage.
This she may be certain of, that I will never
take her by Force, and then he left the
Room.
</p>
<p>
What think you now, Mrs. <i>Pamela</i>, says Mrs.
<i>Jewkes</i>, are you not yet persuaded my Master
hath honourable Designs? I think he hath given
no great Proof of them to-night, said I. Your
Experience I find is not great, says she, but I am
convinced you will shortly be my Mistress, and
then what will become of poor me.
</p>
<p>
With such sort of Discourse we both fell asleep.
Next Morning early my Master sent for
me, and after kissing me, gave a Paper into my
Hand which he bid me read; I did so, and found
it to be a Proposal for settling 250<i>l.</i> a Year on
me, besides several other advantagious Offers, as
Presents of Money and other things. Well,
<i>Pamela</i>, said he, what Answer do you make me
to this. Sir, said I, I value my Vartue more
than all the World, and I had rather be the poorest
Man's Wife, than the richest Man's Whore.
You are a Simpleton, said he; That may be,
and yet I may have as much Wit as some Folks,
cry'd I; meaning me, I suppose, said he, every
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;33]</span>
Man knows himself best, says I. Hussy, says
he, get out of the Room, and let me see your
saucy Face no more, for I find I am in more
Danger than you are, and therefore it shall be
my Business to avoid you as much as I can; and
it shall be mine, thinks I, at every turn to throw
my self in your way. So I went out, and as
I parted, I heard him sigh and say he was bewitched.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> hath been with me since, and she
assures me she is convinced I shall shortly be
Mistress of the Family, and she really behaves
to me, as if she already thought me so. I am
resolved now to aim at it. I thought once of
making a little Fortune by my Person. I now
intend to make a great one by my Vartue. So
asking Pardon for this long Scroll, I am,

But, my dear Child, I am afraid of one Rock
only, That Parson <i>Williams</i>, I wish he was out

sufficient to indulge yourself with Parson <i>Williams</i>,

<p class="nowrap">
<i>Dear Mamma</i>,<br />
</p>
<p>
I Little feared when I sent away my last that all
my Hopes would be so soon frustrated; but I
am certain you will blame Fortune and not me.
To proceed then. About two Hours after I had left
the Squire, he sent for me into the Parlour. <i>Pamela</i>,
said he, and takes me gently by the hand,
will you walk with me in the Garden; yes, Sir,
says I, and pretended to tremble; but I hope
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;35]</span>
your Honour will not be rude. Indeed, says he,
you have nothing to fear from me, and I have something
to tell you, which if it doth not please you,
cannot offend. We walked out together, and he
began thus, <i>Pamela</i>, will you tell me Truth?
Doth the Resistance you make to my Attempts
proceed from Vartue only, or have I not some
Rival in thy dear Bosom who might be more successful?
Sir, says I, I do assure you I never had
a thought of any Man in the World. How says
he, not of Parson <i>Williams</i>! Parson <i>Williams</i>,
says I, is the last Man upon Earth; and if I was
a Dutchess, and your Honour was to make your
Addresses to me, you would have no reason to
be jealous of any Rival, especially such a Fellow
as Parson <i>Williams</i>. If ever I had a Liking, I
am sure&mdash;&mdash;but I am not worthy of you one
Way, and no Riches should ever bribe me the
other. My Dear, says he, you are worthy of
every Thing, and suppose I should lay aside all
Considerations of Fortune, and disregard the Censure
of the World, and marry you. O Sir, says
I, I am sure you can have no such Thoughts, you
cannot demean your self so low. Upon my Soul,
I am in earnest, says he,&mdash;O Pardon me, Sir,
says I, you can't persuade me of this. How Mistress,
says he, in a violent Rage, do you give
me the Lie? Hussy, I have a great mind to
box your saucy Ears, but I am resolved I will
never put it in your power to affront me again,
and therefore I desire you to prepare your self for
your Journey this Instant. You deserve no better
Vehicle than a Cart; however, for once you
shall have a Chariot, and it shall be ready for
you within this half Hour; and so he flung from
me in a Fury.
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;36]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>What a foolish Thing it is for a Woman to dally
too long with her Lover's Desires; how many have
owed their being old Maids to their holding out
too long.</i>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> came me to presently, and told me,
I must make ready with all the Expedition imaginable,
for that my Master had ordered the
Chariot, and that if I was not prepared to go in
 it, I should be turned out of Doors, and left
to find my way Home on Foot. This startled
me a little, yet I resolved, whether in the right
or wrong, not to submit nor ask Pardon: For
that know you, Mamma, you never could your self
bring me to from my Childhood: Besides, I thought
he would be no more able to master his Passion
for me now, than he had been hitherto; and if
he sent two Horses away with me, I concluded
he would send four to fetch me back. So, truly,
I resolved to brazen it out, and with all the Spirit
I could muster up, I told Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> I was
vastly pleased with the News she brought me;
that no one ever went more readily than I should,
from a Place where my Vartue had been in continual
Danger. That as for my Master, he might
easily get those who were fit for his Purpose; but,
for my Part, I preferred my Vartue to all Rakes
whatever&mdash;&mdash;And for his Promises, and his Offers
to me, I don't value them of a Fig&mdash;Not of a
Fig, Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i>; and then I snapt my Fingers.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> went in with me, and helped me to
pack up my little All, which was soon done;
being no more than two Day-Caps, two Night-Caps,
five Shifts, one Sham, a Hoop, a Quilted-Petticoat,
two Flannel-Petticoats, two pair of
Stockings, one odd one, a pair of lac'd Shoes, a
short flowered Apron, a lac'd Neck-Handkerchief,
one Clog, and almost another, and some
<a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;37]</span>
few Books: as, <i>A full Answer to a plain and
true Account</i>, &amp;c. <i>The Whole Duty of Man</i>, with
only the Duty to one's Neighbour, torn out.
The Third Volume of the <i>Atalantis</i>. <i>Venus in
the Cloyster: Or, the Nun in her Smock. God's
Dealings with Mr. Whitefield. Orfus and Eurydice.</i>
Some Sermon-Books; and two or three
Plays, with their Titles, and Part of the first
Act torn off.
</p>
<p>
So as soon as we had put all this into a Bundle,
the Chariot was ready, and I took leave of all
the Servants, and particularly Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i>, who
pretended, I believe, to be more sorry to part
with me than she was; and then crying out with
an Air of Indifference, my Service to my Master,
when he condescends to enquire after me, I flung
my self into the Chariot, and bid <i>Robin</i> drive
on.
</p>
<p>
We had not gone far, before a Man on Horseback,
riding full Speed, overtook us, and coming
up to the Side of the Chariot, threw a Letter into
the Window, and then departed without uttering
a single Syllable.
</p>
<p>
I immediately knew the Hand of my dear
<i>Williams</i>, and was somewhat surprised, tho' I
did not apprehend the Contents to be so terrible,
as by the following exact Copy you will find
them.

That Disrespect for the Clergy, which I

Fact. I was proceeding to my Neighbour <i>Spruce's</i>
Church, where I purposed to preach a Funeral
Sermon, on the Death of Mr. <i>John Gage</i>, the
Exciseman; when I was met by two Persons
who are, it seems, Sheriffs Officers, and arrested
for the 150<i>l.</i> which your Master had lent me;
and unless I can find Bail within these few Days,
of which I see no likelihood, I shall be carried
to Goal. This accounts for my not having visited
you these two Days; which you might assure
yourself, I should not have fail'd, if the <i>Potestas</i>
had not been wanting. If you can by any means
prevail on your Master to release me, I beseech
you so to do, not scrupling any thing for Righteousness
sake. I hear he is just arrived in this

The Fate of poor Mr. <i>Williams</i> shocked me
more than my own: For, as the <i>Beggar's Opera</i>
says, <i>Nothing moves one so much as a great Man

forced to submit so low, to one whom I have
often heard him say, he despises, is, I think, a

by the Post, it will be in Town a little before me.&mdash;&mdash;Don't

In my last I left off at our sitting down to
Supper on our Wedding Night,<a name="ref_1_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1_1" class="fnref">[1]</a> where I behaved
with as much Bashfulness as the purest
Virgin in the World could have done. The most
difficult Task for me was to blush; however,
by holding my Breath, and Squeezing my Cheeks
with my Handkerchief, I did pretty well. My
Husband was extreamly eager and impatient to
have Supper removed, after which he gave me
leave to retire into my Closet for a Quarter of an
<a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;41]</span>
Hour, which was very agreeable to me; for I
employed that time in writing to Mr. <i>Williams</i>,
who, as I informed you in my last, is released,
and presented to the Living, upon the Death of
the last Parson. Well, at last I went to Bed,
and my Husband soon leap'd in after me; where,
I shall only assure you, I acted my Part in such
a manner, that no Bridegroom was ever better
Satisfied with his Bride's Virginity. And to confess
the Truth, I might have been well enough
Satisfied too, if I had never been acquainted with
Parson <i>Williams</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>O what regard Men who marry Widows should
have to the Qualifications of their former Husbands.</i>
</p>
<p>
We did not rise the next Morning till eleven,
and then we sat down to Breakfast; I eat two
Slices of Bread and Butter, and drank three Dishes
of Tea, with a good deal of Sugar, and we both
look'd very silly. After Breakfast we drest our
selves, he in a blue Camblet Coat, very richly
lac'd, and Breeches of the same; with a Paduafoy
Waistcoat, laced with Silver; and I, in one of
my Mistress's Gowns. I will have finer when I
come to Town. We then took a Walk in the
Garden, and he kissed me several times, and
made me a Present of 100 Guineas, which I gave
away before Night to the Servants, twenty to
one, and ten to another, and so on.
</p>
<p>
We eat a very hearty Dinner, and about eight
in the Evening went to Bed again. He is prodigiously
fond of me; but I don't like him half
so well as my dear <i>Williams</i>. The next Morning
we rose earlier, and I asked him for another
hundred Guineas, and he gave them me. I sent
fifty to Parson <i>Williams</i>, and the rest I gave
away, two Guineas to a Beggar, and three to a
<a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;42]</span>
Man riding along the Road, and the rest to other
People. I long to be in <i>London</i> that I may have
an Opportunity of laying some out, as well as
giving away. I believe I shall buy every thing
I see. What signifies having Money if one doth
not spend it.
</p>
<p>
The next Day, as soon as I was up, I asked
him for another Hundred. Why, my Dear, says
he, I don't grudge you any thing, but how was
it possible for you to lay out the other two Hundred
here. La! Sir, says I, I hope I am not
obliged to give you an Account of every Shilling;
Troth, that will be being your Servant
still. I assure you, I married you with no such
view, besides did not you tell me I should be
Mistress of your Estate? And I will be too. For
tho' I brought no Fortune, I am as much your
Wife as if I had brought a Million&mdash;yes, but,
my Dear, says he, if you had brought a Million,
you would spend it all at this rate; besides, what
will your Expences be in <i>London</i>, if they are so
great here. Truly, says I, Sir, I shall live like
other Ladies of my Fashion; and if you think,
because I was a Servant, that I shall be contented
to be governed as you please, I will shew you,
you are mistaken. If you had not cared to marry
me, you might have let it alone. I did not
ask you, nor I did not court you. Madam, says
he, I don't value a hundred Guineas to oblige
you; but this is a Spirit which I did not expect
in you, nor did I ever see any Symptoms of it before.
O but Times are altered now, I am your
Lady, Sir; yes to my Sorrow, says he, I am
afraid&mdash;and I am afraid to my Sorrow too: For
if you begin to use me in this manner already,
I reckon you will beat me before a Month's at an
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;43]</span>
end. I am sure if you did, it would injure me
less than this barbarous Treatment; upon which
I burst into Tears, and pretended to fall into a
Fit. This frighted him out of his wits, and he
called up the Servants. Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> immediately
came in, and she and another of the Maids
fell heartily to rubbing my Temples, and holding
Smelling-Bottles to my Nose. Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i>
told him she fear'd I should never recover, upon
which he began to beat his Breasts, and cried out,
O my dearest Angel, Curse on my passionate
Temper, I have destroy'd her, I have destroy'd
her!&mdash;&mdash;would she had spent my whole Estate rather
than this had happened. Speak to me, my
Love, I will melt myself into Gold for thy
Pleasure. At last having pretty well tired my
self with counterfeiting, and imagining I had
continu'd long enough for my purpose in the
sham Fit, I began to move my Eyes, to loosen
my Teeth, and to open my Hands, which Mr.
<i>Booby</i> no sooner perceived than he embraced and
kissed me with the eagerest Extacy, asked my
Pardon on his Knees for what I had suffered
through his Folly and Perverseness, and without
more Questions fetched me the Money. I fancy
I have effectually prevented any farther Refusals
or Inquiry into my Expences. It would be hard
indeed, that a Woman who marries a Man only
for his Money, should be debarred from spending
it.
</p>
<p>
Well, after all things were quiet, we sat down
to Breakfast, yet I resolved not to smile once,
nor to say one good-natured, or good-humoured
Word on any Account.
</p>
<p>
<i>Nothing can be more prudent in a Wife, than
a sullen Backwardness to Reconciliation; it makes</i>
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;44]</span>
<i>a Husband fearful of offending by the Length of
his Punishment.</i>
</p>
<p>
When we were drest, the Coach was by my
Desire ordered for an Airing, which we took in
it. A long Silence prevailed on both Sides, tho'
he constantly squeezed my Hand, and kissed me,
and used other Familiarities, which I peevishly
permitted. At last, I opened my Mouth first.&mdash;And
so, says I, you are sorry you are married;&mdash;Pray,
my Dear, says he, forget what I said
in a Passion. Passion, says I, is apter to discover
our Thoughts than to teach us to counterfeit.
Well, says he, whether you will believe me or
no, I solemnly vow, I would not change thee for
the richest Woman in the Universe. No, I
warrant you, says I; and yet you could refuse
me a nasty hundred Pound. At these very Words,
I saw Mr. <i>Williams</i> riding as fast as he could
across a Field; and I looked out, and saw a Lease
of Greyhounds coursing a Hare, which they presently
killed, and I saw him alight, and take it
from them.
</p>
<p>
My Husband ordered <i>Robin</i> to drive towards
him, and looked horribly out of humour, which
I presently imputed to Jealousy. So I began with
him first; for that is the wisest way. La, Sir,
says I; what makes you look so Angry and
Grim? Doth the Sight of Mr. <i>Williams</i> give you
all this Uneasiness? I am sure, I would never
have married a Woman of whom I had so bad
an Opinion, that I must be uneasy at every Fellow
she looks at. My Dear, answer'd he, you
injure me extremely, you was not in my Thoughts,
nor, indeed, could be, while they were covered
by so morose a Countenance; I am justly angry
with that Parson, whose Family hath been raised
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;45]</span>
from the Dunghill by ours; and who hath received
from me twenty Kindnesses, and yet is
not contented to destroy the Game in all other
Places, which I freely give him leave to do; but
hath the Impudence to pursue a few Hares,
which I am desirous to preserve, round about
this little Coppice. Look, my Dear, pray look,
says he; I believe he is going to turn Higler.
To Confess the Truth, he had no less than three
ty'd up behind his Horse, and a fourth he held in
his Hand.
</p>
<p>
Pshaw, says I, I wish all the Hares in the
Country were d&mdash;&mdash;d (the Parson himself
chid me afterwards for using the Word, tho' it
was in his Service.) Here's a Fuss, indeed,
about a nasty little pitiful Creature, that is not
half so useful as a Cat. You shall not persuade
me, that a Man of your Understanding, would
quarrel with a Clergyman for such a Trifle. No,
no, I am the Hare, for whom poor Parson <i>Williams</i>
is persecuted; and Jealousy is the Motive.
If you had married one of your Quality Ladies,
she would have had Lovers by dozens, she
would so; but because you have taken a Servant-Maid,
forsooth! you are jealous if she but
looks (and then I began to Water) at a poor
P&mdash;&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;rson in his Pu&mdash;&mdash;u&mdash;&mdash;u&mdash;&mdash;lpit,
and then out burst a Flood of Tears.
</p>
<p>
My Dear, said he, for Heaven's sake dry your
Eyes, and don't let him be a Witness of your
Tears, which I should be sorry to think might be
imputed to my Unkindness; I have already given
you Some Proofs that I am not jealous of this
Parson; I will now give you a very strong one:
For I will mount my Horse, and you shall take
<i>Williams</i> into the Coach. You may be sure, this
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;46]</span>
Motion pleased me, yet I pretended to make as
light of it as possible, and told him, I was sorry his
Behaviour had made some such glaring Instance,
necessary to the perfect clearing my Character.
</p>
<p>
He soon came up to Mr. <i>Williams</i>, who had
attempted to ride off, but was prevented by one of
our Horsemen, whom my Husband sent to stop
him. When we met, my Husband asked him
how he did with a very good-humoured Air, and
told him he perceived he had found good Sport
that Morning. He answered pretty moderate, Sir;
for that he had found the three Hares tied on to
the Saddle dead in a Ditch (winking on me at
the same time), and added he was sorry there
was such a Rot among them.
</p>
<p>
Well, says Mr. <i>Booby</i>, if you please, Mr.
<i>Williams</i>, you shall come in and ride with my
Wife. For my own part, I will mount on
Horseback; for it is fine Weather, and besides,
it doth not become me to loll in a Chariot, whilst
a Clergyman rides on Horseback.
</p>
<p>
At which Words, Mr. <i>Booby</i> leap'd out, and
Mr. <i>Williams</i> leap'd in, in an Instant, telling my
Husband as he mounted, he was glad to see such
a Reformation, and that if he continued his Respect
to the Clergy, he might assure himself of Blessings
from above.
</p>
<p>
It was now that the Airing began to grow pleasant
to me. Mr. <i>Williams</i>, who never had but one
Fault, <i>viz.</i> that he generally smells of Tobacco,
was now perfectly sweet; for he had for two
Days together enjoined himself as a Penance,
not to smoke till he had kissed my Lips. I will
loosen you from that Obligation, says I, and observing
my Husband looking another way, I
gave him a charming Kiss, and then he asked
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;47]</span>
me Questions concerning my Wedding-night;
this actually made me blush: I vow I did not
think, it had been in him.
</p>
<p>
As he went along, he began to discourse very
learnedly, and told me the Flesh and the Spirit
were too distinct Matters, which had not the
least relation to each other. That all immaterial
Substances (those were his very Words) such as
Love, Desire, and so forth, were guided by the
Spirit: But fine Houses, large Estates, Coaches,
and dainty Entertainments were the Product of
the Flesh. Therefore, says he, my Dear, you
have two Husbands, one the Object of your
Love, and to satisfy your Desire; the other the
Object of your Necessity, and to furnish you
with those other Conveniences. (I am sure I
remember every Word, for he repeated it three
Times; O he is very good whenever I desire
him to repeat a thing to me three times he always
doth it!) as then the Spirit is preferable, to the
Flesh, so am I preferable to your other Husband,
to whom I am antecedent in Time likewise. I
say these things, my Dear, (said he) to satisfie
your Conscience. A Fig, for my Conscience,
said I, when shall I meet you again in the
Garden?
</p>
<p>
My Husband now rode up to the Chariot, and
asked us how we did&mdash;I hate the Sight of him.
Mr. <i>Williams</i> answered very well, at your Service.
They then talked of the Weather, and
other things, I wished him gone again, every
Minute; but all in vain I had no more Opportunity
of conversing with Mr. <i>Williams</i>.
</p>
<p>
Well; at Dinner Mr. <i>Booby</i> was very civil to
Mr. <i>Williams</i>, and told him he was sorry for
what had happened, and would make him sufficient
<a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;48]</span>
Amends, if in his power, and desired him
to accept of a Note for fifty Pounds; which he
was so <i>good</i> to receive, notwithstanding all that
had past; and told Mr. <i>Booby</i>, he hop'd he
would be forgiven, and that he would pray
for him.
</p>
<p>
We make a charming Fool of him, i'fackins;
Times are finely altered, I have entirely got the
better of him, and am resolved never to give him
his Humour.
</p>
<p>
<i>O how foolish it is in a Woman, who hath once
got the Reins into her own Hand, ever to quit
them again.</i>
</p>
<p>
After Dinner Mr. <i>Williams</i> drank the Church
<i>et cætera</i>; and smiled on me; when my Husband's
Turn came, he drank <i>et cætera</i> and the
Church; for which he was very severely rebuked
by Mr. <i>Williams</i>; it being a high Crime, it seems,
to name any thing before the Church. I do not
know what <i>Et cetera</i> is, but I believe it is something
concerning chusing Pallament Men; for
I asked if it was not a Health to Mr. <i>Booby's</i> Borough,
and Mr. <i>Williams</i> with a hearty Laugh
answered, Yes, Yes, it is his Borough we mean.
</p>
<p>
I slipt out as soon as I could, hoping Mr.
<i>Williams</i> would finish the Squire, as I have heard
him say he could easily do, and come to me; but
it happened quite otherwise, for in about half an
Hour, <i>Booby</i> came to me, and told me he had
left Mr. <i>Williams</i>, the Mayor of his Borough,
and two or three Aldermen heartily at it, and
asked me if I would go hear <i>Williams</i> sing a
Catch, which, added he, he doth to a Miracle.
</p>
<p>
Every Opportunity of seeing my dear <i>Williams</i>,
was agreeable to me, which indeed I scarce had at
this time; for when we returned, the whole
<a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;49]</span>
Corporation were got together, and the Room
was in a Cloud of Tobacco; Parson <i>Williams</i> was
at the upper End of the Table, and he hath pure
round cherry Cheeks, and his Face look'd all the
World to nothing like the Sun in a Fog. If the
Sun had a Pipe in his Mouth, there would be no
Difference.
</p>
<p>
I began now to grow uneasy, apprehending I
should have no more of Mr. <i>Williams's</i> Company
that Evening, and not at all caring for my
Husband, I advised him to sit down and drink
for his Country with the rest of the Company;
but he refused, and desired me to give him some
Tea; swearing nothing made him so sick, as to
hear a Parcel of Scoundrels, roaring forth the
Principles of honest Men over their Cups, when,
says he, I know most of them are such empty
Blockheads, that they don't know their right
Hand from their left; and that Fellow there, who
hath talked so much of <i>Shipping</i>, at the left Side of
the Parson, in whom they all place a Confidence, if
I don't take care, will sell them to my Adversary.
</p>
<p>
I don't know why I mention this Stuff to you;
for I am sure I know nothing about <i>Pollitricks</i>,
more than Parson <i>Williams</i> tells me; who says
that the Court-side are in the right on't, and that
every Christian ought to be on the same with
the Bishops.
</p>
<p>
When we had finished our Tea, we walked in
the Garden till it was dark, and then my Husband
proposed, instead of returning to the Company,
(which I desired, that I might see Parson
<i>Williams</i> again,) to sup in another Room by our
selves, which, for fear of making him jealous,
and considering too, that Parson <i>Williams</i> would
be pretty far gone, I was obliged to consent to.
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;50]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>O! what a devilish thing it is, for a Woman
to be obliged to go to bed to a spindle-shanked young
Squire, she doth not like, when there is a jolly
Parson in the same House she is fond of.</i>
</p>
<p>
In the Morning I grew very peevish, and in the
Dumps, notwithstanding all he could say or do to
please me. I exclaimed against the Priviledge of
Husbands, and vowed I would not be pulled and
tumbled about. At last he hit on the only Method,
which could have brought me into Humour,
and proposed to me a Journey to <i>London</i>, within
a few Days. This you may easily guess pleased
me; for besides the Desire which I have of shewing
my self forth, of buying fine Cloaths, Jewels,
Coaches, Houses, and ten thousand other fine
things, Parson <i>Williams</i> is, it seems, going thither
too, to be <i>instuted</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>O! what a charming Journey I shall have;
for I hope to keep the dear Man in the Chariot
with me all the way; and that foolish Booby (for
that is the Name Mr.</i> Williams <i>hath set him) will
ride on Horseback.</i>
</p>
<p>
So as I shall have an Opportunity of seeing you
so shortly, I think I will mention no more Matters
to you now. O I had like to have forgot one
very material thing; which is that it will look
horribly, for a Lady of my Quality and Fashion,
to own such a Woman as you for my Mother.
Therefore we must meet in private only, and
if you will never claim me, nor mention me to
any one, I will always allow you what is very
handsome. Parson <i>Williams</i> hath greatly advised
me in this; and says, he thinks I should do
very well to lay out twenty Pounds, and set you
up in a little Chandler's Shop: but you must remember
all my Favours to you will depend on
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;51]</span>
your Secrecy; for I am positively resolved, I will
not be known to be your Daughter; and if you
tell any one so, I shall deny it with all my Might,
which Parson <i>Williams</i> says, I may do with a
safe Conscience, being now a married Woman.
So I rest
</p>
<p class="signature">
<i>Your humble Servant</i>,<br />
</p>
<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Shamela</span>.<br />
</p>
<p>
<i>P. S.</i> The strangest Fancy hath enter'd into
my Booby's Head, that can be imagined. He is
resolved to have a Book made about him and me;
he proposed it to Mr. <i>Williams</i>, and offered him
a Reward for his Pains; but he says he never
writ any thing of that kind, but will recommend
my Husband, when he comes to Town, to a
Parson <i>who does that Sort of Business for Folks</i>, one
who can make my Husband, and me, and Parson
<i>Williams</i>, to be all great People; for he <i>can make
black white</i>, it seems. Well, but they say my
Name is to be altered, Mr. <i>Williams</i>, says the
first Syllabub hath too comical a Sound, so it is
to be changed into <i>Pamela</i>; I own I can't imagine
what can be said; for to be sure I shan't confess
any of my Secrets to them, and so I whispered
Parson <i>Williams</i> about that, who answered me, I
need not give my self any Trouble; for the Gentleman
<i>who writes Lives</i>, never asked more than a
few Names of his Customers, and that he made all
the rest out of his own Head; you mistake, Child,
said he, if you apprehend any Truths are to be delivered.
So far on the contrary, if you had not
been acquainted with the Name, you would not
<a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;52]</span>
have known it to be your own History. I have
seen a <i>Piece of his Performance</i>, where the Person,
whose Life was written, could he have risen from
the Dead again, would not have even suspected
he had been aimed at, unless by the Title of the
Book, which was superscribed with his Name.
Well, all these Matters are strange to me, yet I
can't help laughing, to think I shall see my self
in a printed Book.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
So much for Mrs. <i>Shamela</i>, or <i>Pamela</i>, which
I have taken Pains to transcribe from the Originals,
sent down by her Mother in a Rage, at the
Proposal in her last Letter. The Originals themselves
are in my hands, and shall be communicated
to you, if you think proper to make them
publick; and certainly they will have their Use.
The Character of <i>Shamela</i>, will make young
Gentlemen wary how they take the most fatal
Step both to themselves and Families, by youthful,
hasty and improper Matches; indeed, they
may assure themselves, that all Such Prospects of
Happiness are vain and delusive, and that they
sacrifice all the solid Comforts of their Lives, to
a very transient Satisfaction of a Passion, which
how hot so ever it be, will be soon cooled; and
when cooled, will afford them nothing but
Repentance.
</p>
<p>
Can any thing be more miserable, than to be
despised by the whole World, and that must certainly
be the Consequence; to be despised by the
Person obliged, which it is more than probable
will be the Consequence, and of which, we see
an Instance in <i>Shamela</i>; and lastly to despise one's
self, which must be the Result of any Reflection
on so weak and unworthy a Choice.
<a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;53]</span>
</p>
<p>
As to the Character of Parson <i>Williams</i>, I am
sorry it is a true one. Indeed those who do not
know him, will hardly believe it so; but what
Scandal doth it throw on the Order to have one
bad Member, unless they endeavour to screen
and protect him? In him you see a Picture of
almost every Vice exposed in nauseous and odious
Colours; and if a Clergyman would ask me by
what Pattern he should form himself, I would
say, Be the reverse of <i>Williams</i>: So far therefore
he may be of use to the Clergy themselves,
and though God forbid there should be many
<i>Williams's</i> amongst them, you and I are too
honest to pretend, that the Body wants no Reformation.
</p>
<p>
To say the Truth, I think no greater Instance
of the contrary can be given than that which appears
in your Letter. The confederating to cry
up a nonsensical ridiculous Book, (I believe the
most extensively so of any ever yet published,)
and to be so weak and so wicked as to pretend
to make it a Matter of Religion; whereas so far
from having any moral Tendency, the Book is
by no means innocent: For,
</p>
<p>
<i>First</i>, There are many lascivious Images in it,
very improper to be laid before the Youth of
either Sex.
</p>
<p>
<i>2dly</i>, Young Gentlemen are here taught, that
to marry their Mother's Chambermaids, and to
indulge the Passion of Lust, at the Expence of
Reason and Common Sense, is an Act of Religion,
Virtue, and Honour; and, indeed the surest
Road to Happiness.
</p>
<p>
<i>3dly</i>, All Chambermaids are strictly enjoyned
to look out after their Masters; they are taught
to use little Arts to that purpose: And lastly, are
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;54]</span>
countenanced in Impertinence to their Superiors,
and in betraying the Secrets of Families.
</p>
<p>
<i>4thly</i>, In the Character of Mrs. <i>Jewkes</i> Vice
is rewarded; whence every Housekeeper may
learn the Usefulness of pimping and bawding
for her Master.
</p>
<p>
<i>5thly</i>, In Parson <i>Williams</i>, who is represented
as a faultless Character, we see a busy Fellow,
intermeddling with the private Affairs of his Patron,
whom he is very ungratefully forward to
expose and condemn on every Occasion.
</p>
<p>
Many more Objections might, if I had Time
or Inclination, be made to this Book; but I apprehend,
what hath been said is sufficient to persuade
you of the use which may arise from publishing
an Antidote to this Poison. I have therefore
sent you the Copies of these Papers, and if
you have Leisure to communicate them to the
Press, I will transmit you the Originals, tho' I
assure you, the Copies are exact.
</p>
<p>
I shall only add, that there is not the least
Foundation for any thing which is said of Lady
<i>Davers</i>, or any of the other Ladies; all that is
merely to be imputed to the Invention of the
Biographer. I have particularly enquired after
Lady <i>Davers</i>, and dont hear Mr. <i>Booby</i> hath
such a Relation, or that there is indeed any such
Person existing. I am,

I Have read over the History of <i>Shamela</i>, as it
appears in those authentick Copies you favour'd
me with, and am very much ashamed of the
Character, which I was hastily prevailed on to
give that Book. I am equally angry with the
